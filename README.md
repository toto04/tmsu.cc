### Why?

This thing is dead simple, and other services can integrate with it via API to create
a butload of shortened URLs. Very cool, very free, which makes it even cooler.

#### Yeah ok but why Next of all things???

No good reason really, but it works, the REST API is handled with `ts-rest`, UI
with `shadcn/ui`, allowing me to autogenerate both an `openapi.json` file and the
docs for it with `@scalar/api-reference-react`.

If I was to do it again I'd try `Hono` with SSG for the UI.
